# Travel-buddy

## User Story

It was Thomas Paine who said "My state is the world, and my religiion is to do good". In the state of the world today, travel is no longer a luxury, but a way of life.
There are always two questions every traveler asks themselevs, regardless of their journey, or their desination:
1. What are we doing?
2. What clothes do I need to pack?
Our goal was to find answers to these pressing questions in a single source. Using The Travel Buddy, these questions are answered at your finger tips. The time saved can be used to worry about your actual concerns, like the big App Presentation!
The Travel Buddy is truly Man's Best Friend
